# Run the outstanding Qwen3.8 tuning experiments back to back, unattended.
#
# Each experiment needs a different serve config, so each one costs a full
# engine restart (~4-8 min on this cluster, longer for the 1M recipe). Doing
# them by hand means babysitting a terminal for an hour; this drives the whole
# matrix and leaves a JSON file per variant to diff.
#
# It expects the cluster to itself. Stop the running unit first:
#
#   sudo systemctl stop vllm@qwen3.8-27b-nvfp4-1m.service
#   tools/bench-campaign.sh                 # every variant
#   tools/bench-campaign.sh mtp-triton 1m-triton   # or a subset
#
# Results land in $OUTDIR (default /tmp/bench-campaign) as
# bench-<variant>.json and quality-<variant>.json, plus a run log each.
#
# NOTE: this script has not itself been executed end to end -- cluster access
# was unavailable when it was written. The pieces it calls (run-recipe.sh,
# bench-serving.py, quality-probe.py) have all been run individually against
# this cluster. Watch the first variant through before walking away.
